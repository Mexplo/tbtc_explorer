# TBTC Explorer

### Description
1. TBTC explorer distinguishes and organizes the list of deposits and the list of redeem across the Keep network. On the explorer home page, we show you the key data of TBTC.
2. You can search for your address on the explorer homepage to view details of your address, including all deposits and redeem records of your address, the TBTC balance, and the TDT and FRT.
3. Visualize the TBTC lifecycle. On the details page, TBTC explorer shows the complete flow of transactions, and now you can see where your transactions have gone, with links to the associated etherscan.io.
4. Last but not least, TBTC explorer provides a list of all available TDTs in the Keep network. Many newbies encounter TDTs not available when redeeming TBTC, and they don't know where to look for suitable TDTs. So TBTC explorer list all available TDTs and provides sorting by size.
